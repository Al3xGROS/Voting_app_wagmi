This is a [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi)

# Getting Started

The site is live and deployed thanks to Vercel. Here is the URL: [https://votingapp-eta.vercel.app/](https://votingapp-eta.vercel.app/).

However, if you want to compile it on your machine:

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/pages/index.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.
